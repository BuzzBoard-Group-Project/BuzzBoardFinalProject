## Overview

### Description
BuzzBoard is a campus-centric app designed to enhance student engagement, streamline event organization, and provide a platform for student feedback. It serves as a hub where students can share insights, stay informed about events, and connect with campus life in a meaningful way. This app will help focus on boosting campus engagement by making it easier to find and track events on and off campus. Simplifies event organization for student leaders and campus groups. As well as, empower student voices through direct feedback features.


### App Evaluation

- **Category:** Campus Life / Student Engagement

- **Mobile:** Works on Android devices 

- **Story:** BuzzBoard was born from a common challenge faced by students on college and university campuses — the struggle to stay connected and informed about what’s happening around them. While flyers on bulletin boards and scattered social media posts tried to bridge the gap, there wasn’t a centralized platform where students could seamlessly engage with campus life.
- **Market:** College and University Students (Ages 18-24)
- **Habit:** BuzzBoard revolves around fostering daily student engagement and promoting a sense of belonging on campus. It becomes a go-to platform for students, organizations, and administrators by seamlessly integrating into their routines.
- **Scope:** BuzzBoard defines the key features, functionalities, and limitations of the application. It ensures that the development team has a clear understanding of the goals and priorities of the project.
